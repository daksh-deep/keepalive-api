/**
 * Sets up a cron job to periodically send a keep-alive request to a specified URL.
 * 
 * This function uses the `node-cron` library to schedule a task that sends an HTTPS
 * GET request to the URL specified in the environment variable `KEEP_ALIVE_URL`.
 * The task runs every 10 minutes to ensure the target service remains active, even
 * when idle for extended periods.
 * 
 * The cron job logs:
 * - A success message when the request is successfully sent.
 * - An error message if the request fails.
 * 
 * Preconditions:
 * - The `KEEP_ALIVE_URL` environment variable must be defined and valid.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Import and invoke the `keepAlive` function in your application to start the cron job.
 * 
 * Example:
 * ```
 * const keepAlive = require('./utils/keepAlive');
 * keepAlive();
 * ```
 * 
 * Logs:
 * - INFO: Successful keep-alive requests.
 * - ERROR: Failed keep-alive requests.
